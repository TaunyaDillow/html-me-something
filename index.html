        <h2>It began with a simple question...</h2>
        <p>"Now what?"  </p>
        <p>I was halfway through my final year of undergrad studies, finally completing my Art History Degree.
        I spent so much time exploring various courses of study, that I didn't know what I wanted to do once I graduated.
        There isn't much in the field of Art History that one can do with only a Bachlors Degree and by this time
        I was sure that I didn't want to continue this path of education.  So, with about 3 classes remaining until graduation, I needed a plan.</p>
<p>In a fit of practically, I decided to pursue an MBA.  At least that way, I probably could find a job.  I found the Global MBA offered by
    Webster University and decided to apply.  Fortunately, I had quite a bit of the required courses already completed so I only needed to take the GRE and 
purchase a one way ticket to Switzerland! </p>
