    <header><h1>A Truly Global MBA</h1></header>
    <main>
        <h2>It began with a simple question...</h2>
        <p>"Now what?"  </p>
        <p>I was halfway through my final year of undergrad studies, finally completing my Art History Degree.
        I spent so much time exploring various courses of study, that I didn't know what I wanted to do once I graduated.
        There isn't much in the field of Art History that one can do with only a Bachlors Degree and by this time
        I was sure that I didn't want to continue this path of education.  So, with about 3 classes remaining until graduation, I needed a plan.</p>
<p>In a fit of practically, I decided to pursue an MBA.  At least that way, I probably could find a job.  I found the Global MBA offered by
    Webster University and decided to apply.  Fortunately, I had quite a bit of the required courses already completed so I only needed to take the GRE and 
purchase a one way ticket to Switzerland! </p>

            <h2>Geneva, Switzerland</h2>
            <img src="geneva.jpg" alt=Geneva>
            <p>Geneva was our first stop.  A total of 11 students were admitted into the program.  We found out that we were the first group to 
                be in this program.  We were to spend about 2 months here, taking classes in the evenings.  The university provided 
                books and a dorm room, the rest was up to us.  The people in Geneva primarily speak french, but many also speak German.  I spoke neither
                so I had to quickly learn the basics.    
            </p>
            <p>The city is beautiful and very easy to get around.  Being college students, we quickly found a local bar to spend many late nights.  My favorite part
                was stopping by the bakery at 2am for fresh chocolate croissants fresh from the oven!  The baker soon got to know us and sold his 
                treats to us from the kitchen door!

            <h2>Leiden, The Netherlands</h2>
            <img src="leiden.jpg" alt=Leiden>
            <p>By Christmas, we were living in Leiden, a suburb of Amsterdam.  Initially, I thought I would spend most
                of my time in Amsterdam, but there was no need.  Leiden is a beautiful, comfortable, and fun place to live.  
                The greatest challange for me was the lack of sunlight.  Leiden's winters are mild but dark. This is the only time I ever
                considered going to a tanning bed! 
            </p>
            <p>A couple of us bought bikes and used them to get to class and home.  We also took a weekend and rode our bikes to Gouda!
most days were spent studying in a cafe, walking or biking around town, and going to outdoor markets. </p>
<p>Here, one day, we decided to go to the indoor down hill ski resort.  We went downhill skiing in the flattest country on Earth!</p>

            <h2>London, UK</h2>
            <img src="london.jpg" alt=London>
            <p>London was one of my favorite places that we stayed.
                Although expensive, there is so much to do!  Being a student, I was eligible for some discounts, which was
                a blessing as I got to see many shows in the West End for relatively little cash. 
            </p>
            <p>We lived in a neighborhood called "Angel" near the KingsCross station.  We took the Underground to class everyday and between
                my dorm and the train station, I would hear a world of languages being spoken!
